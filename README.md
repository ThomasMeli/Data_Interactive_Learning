# Data_Learning_Tools
Some of the best educational/visualization tools I've seen for learning data science.  I prioritize quality over quantity so will only post the best of the best that I find here.  If you know an awesome tool, feel free to share.

## Deep Learning

* **Distill.pub** - https://distill.pub - This site has probably the highest standard in interactive explanations I've ever seen.  Absolutely amazing work.

## Statistics
* A visual explanation of Permutation Testing - https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/ - 

## Data Structures and Algorithms
* Algorithms Step by Step Visualizer - https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/bubble-sort/visualize/ - This page starts on bubble sort, but there is a highly navigatable menu on the left side with a ton of algorithms on the side.
