# Interactive Data Science Explorables and Learning Tools

Some of the best educational/visualization tools I've seen for learning data science.  I prioritize quality over quantity so will only post the best of the best that I find here. 

The resources below are selected by the following criteria:
* Explained in simple language while still explaining the math without dumbing it down.
* Usually the have some kind of animation or interactive component.
* The visual concepts are presented clearly and unambiguously.


## Explorable Learning Theory

* https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/

## Deep Learning

* **Distill.pub** - https://distill.pub - This site has probably the highest standard in interactive explanations I've ever seen.  Absolutely amazing work.
* **Backpropagation Explainer** - https://xnought.github.io/backprop-explainer/

## Linear Algebra

* **Matrix Multiplication Visualizer** http://matrixmultiplication.xyz

## Statistics

* **Seeing Theory** - https://seeing-theory.brown.edu

* **A visual explanation of Permutation Testing** - https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/ - 

## Data Structures and Algorithms
* **Algorithms Step by Step Visualizer** - https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/bubble-sort/visualize/ - This page starts on bubble sort, but there is a highly navigatable menu on the left side with a ton of algorithms on the side.
