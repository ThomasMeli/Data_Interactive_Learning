# Interactive Data Science Explorables and Learning Tools

Some of the best educational/visualization tools I've seen for learning data science.  I prioritize quality over quantity so will only post the best of the best that I find here. 

The resources below are selected by the following criteria:
* Explained in simple language while still explaining the math without dumbing it down.
* Usually the have some kind of animation or interactive component.
* The visual concepts are presented clearly and unambiguously.
